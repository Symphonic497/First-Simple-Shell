Please input spaces after commands and args when inputing into command line as such:

"exit "
"cd - "
"ls -l -a /proc/tty "

**** IMPORTANT NOTE ****
File has been updated since script was ran, KILL no longer seg faults on no args, instead prints propper error.
CD no longer takes more than one arg.
feel free to test to make sure.
for whatever reason, file * runs correctly when entered a second time. yet ls * works everytime. I do not know why.






=====PROJECT 4=====
Sometimes watchuser is not very robust, sometimes must be input twice to add to LL in my test runs.
Pipelining was not implemented in this built

PLEASE - If having MAKE errors:
